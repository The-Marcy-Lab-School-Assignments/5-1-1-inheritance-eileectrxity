# Question 3
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
One of the four pillars of OOP, polymorphism, is the concept that allows a common (shared) method to have different behaviors depending on the object calling it. Essentially, polymorphism means methods can have **many forms**.

See this demonstrated below:

```js
//superclass (parent class)
class Store {
  constructor(name, products, inventory) {
    this.name = name;
    this.products = products;
    this.inventory = inventory;
 }
  getInventory() { //inherited by child classes
    return [...this.inventory];
 }
  getDetails() { //method intended to be overridden
    return `${this.name} is a ${this.constructor.name.toLowerCase()} that sells ${this.products}.`
 }
};

//subclass (child class) - example 1
class Pharmacy extends Store {
  constructor(name, inventory, technicians) { //added a new param to the constructor specific to instances of Pharmacy class
    super(name, `pharmaceuticals`, inventory); //gave inherited products param a default value of 'pharmaceuticals'
    this.technicians = technicians;
 }
  getDetails() { //polymorphism: inherited method modified with behavior unique to Pharmacy class
    return `${this.name} is a ${this.constructor.name.toLowerCase()} that sells ${this.products}. There are ${this.technicians} staff technicians available.`
 }
};

//subclass (child class) - example 1
class Retailer extends Store {
  constructor(name, inventory) {
    super(name, `merchandise`, inventory); //gave inherited products param a default value of 'merchandise'
 }
  getDetails() { //polymorphism: inherited method modified with behavior unique to Retailer class
    return `${this.name} is a ${this.constructor.name.toLowerCase()} that sells ${this.products}. It has the following stock available: ${this.inventory}`;
 }
};

//creating instances of the child classes
const pharmacy = new Pharmacy('Good Pharm', ['Aspirin', 'Vitamins'], 3);
console.log(pharmacy.getDetails()); //Good Pharm is a pharmacy that sells pharmaceuticals. There are 3 staff technicians available.

const retailer = new Retailer('Theory', ['Clothing', 'Shoes']);
console.log(retailer.getDetails()); //Theory is a retailer that sells merchandise. It has the following stock available: Clothing, Shoes.
```

In the code snippet, the `getDetails()` method in the `Store` class is overridden in both the `Pharmacy` and `Retailer` subclasses, with each subclass outputting similar but different strings. This shows how polymorphism lets the same method name behave differently depending on the class calling it, allowing for tailored functionality unique to each derived class as needed.
