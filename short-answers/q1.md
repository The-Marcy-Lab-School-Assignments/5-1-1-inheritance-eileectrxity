# Question 1
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
The difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method is that an **instance method** is specific to an instance and handles instance-specific data while also being able to access class-level data. Meanwhile, a **class method** is specific to the class, handles class-level data, and cannot access instance-specific data. As such, class methods perform operations that are related to the class as a whole rather than to any individual instance, as with instance methods.

See the comparison overview below:

| Feature              | Instance Method                                | Class Method                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Operates on instance-specific data              | Operates on class-level data shared by all instances |
| **Syntax** | Uses `this` keyword                 | Uses `static` keyword       |
| **Invocation** | Called on an instance of the class              | Called on the class itself, using the class name |
| **Example Usage** | `this.method()` | `Class.method()` |
