# Question 2
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer

Inheritance allows objects to take advantage of the methods and properties defined in a parent class, inherited via the prototype chain. This means that a child class can access and use the functionality of its parent class without having to redefine it, promoting code reuse and organization.

Below, I demonstrated inheritance through a parent class and a child classes derived from it:

```js
//superclass (parent class)
class Store {
  constructor(name, products, inventory) {
    this.name = name;
    this.products = products;
    this.inventory = inventory;
 }
  getInventory() { //method to be inherited by child classes
    return [...this.inventory];
 }
};

//subclass (child class) - example 1
class Pharmacy extends Store {
  constructor(name, inventory, technicians) { //added a new param to the constructor specific to instances of Pharmacy class
    super(name, `pharmaceuticals`, inventory); //gave inherited products param a value of 'pharmaceuticals' for all instances of Pharmacy class
    this.technicians = technicians;
 }
  getStaff() { //new method specific to instances of Pharmacy class (parent class does not have it and can't invoke it)
    return `Staff technicians available: ${this.technicians}.`;
 }
};

//creating instances of the child classes
const store = new Store('Random Store', 'Merchandise', ['Games', 'Toys']);
console.log(store.getInventory()); //['Games', 'Toys']
console.log(store.getStaff()); //throws a TypeError because getStaff() is not defined in Store class prototype chain, only the Pharmacy chain

const pharmacy = new Pharmacy('Good Pharm', ['Aspirin', 'Vitamins'], 3);
console.log(pharmacy.getInventory()); //['Aspirin', 'Vitamins']
console.log(pharmacy.getStaff()); //Staff technicians available: 3.
```

As you can see, there was no need to redefine the `getInventory()` method in the Pharmacy class, as it is inherited from the parent `Store` class through the prototype chain.
